# Linux Account Setup

Linux Account Setup is a collection of scripts, config files, and documentation on how I like to setup my Linux account. Since I work between both Linux and Windows, I've attempted to make most of the command line components compatible on both real Linux terminals as well as pseudo-Linux terminals like MSYS. Any component that only works on one or the other will say so in its documentation and will do a platform check before execution in the case of scripts.
